# Café Event Manager Application

## Description

The Café Event Manager is intended to streamline the process of planning a meeting at a local coffee shop for both customers and staff.  It will allow users to book tables (and invite their friends/colleagues), pre-order food and drinks, and store their information in an account.  The application consists of a customer-facing client interface, a café staff/administrator interface, and a set of web APIs to handle booking management, order processing, and user authentication.

## Problem Domain

Many coffee shops offer private event bookings but lack a sophisticated reservation and order management system.  Customers may need to call or email to make reservations, while staff manually record and track bookings as well as orders for food and drinks.  This can lead to miscommunication and inefficiency.

At a busy coffee shop, customers want a seamless experience in booking reservations, inviting friends/colleagues, and pre-ordering food and drinks.  Businesses also benefit from being able to track this information in advance, making it easier to plan for peak hours and to prepare orders ahead of time.  This system can reduce wait times and ease communication between customers and staff, making a more pleasantly automated experience for everyone.

## Users

The intended users of this application fall into two categories:
1.	Customers of the café.
2.	Staff and managers of the café.

Customers will be enabled to book tables, place orders for food and drinks, and invite guests to an event.  Café staff will be able to manage event reservations and view table availability, view and process customer orders, and manage pricing and booking categories.
